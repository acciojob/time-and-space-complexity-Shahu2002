	<h1>Information About TIme and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm 
		is efficient to the amount of time taken by an algorithm 
		to run as a function of the length of the input</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity is the parallel concept to time 
		complexity. For example, if we want to initialize
		an array of n integers, then its space complexity
		would be O(n).</b</p>
